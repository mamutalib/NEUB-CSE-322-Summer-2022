	  3. If AL contains 1 or 3, display "o"; if AL contains 2 or 4,display "e".
	  4. Take a number from 0-9 as input and print if it is odd or even.
	  5. Read a character, and if it's an uppercase letter, display it.
	  6. Read a character. If it's "y" or "Y", display it; otherwise, terminate the program.

	1. Introduction to logical instructions
	2. Use TEST instruction to check if the register AX has a value 0 or not. If AX contains 0 print 0 otherwise do nothing.
	3. Use logical instructions to check if an input number is odd or even. If the number is odd print 'O' if even print 'E'.
	4. Use only logical instruction to convert characters from uppercase to lowercase
	5. Use only logical instruction to convert characters from lowercase to uppercase
	6. Use logical instructions to do a case flip. If the input is uppercase convert to lowescase and 	if input is lowercase convert to uppercase.
	7. Rotate and shift instructions
	8. Introduction to Stack
